# Mapping Healthcare Access in Chicago Neighborhoods

## Project Summary

In this project, I explore how access to healthcare facilities varies across neighborhoods in Chicago, and whether income levels influence that access. My goal is to identify communities that may be underserved in terms of proximity to hospitals or clinics, and to assess whether income inequality is associated with disparities in access.

To do this, I combine geographic data with socioeconomic indicators such as population, income, and primary care coverage. I use Python geospatial libraries to visualize and quantify distances to the nearest healthcare facility, and apply basic statistical and machine learning methods to look for meaningful patterns.

## Key Questions

- Which neighborhoods in Chicago are far from hospitals and clinics?
- Are low-income areas more likely to experience reduced access?
- How does primary care coverage relate to proximity or income?
- Are there other factors beyond income that explain healthcare access?

## Methods and Tools

- Python: pandas, geopandas, folium, scikit-learn
- Geospatial analysis and mapping
- Statistical analysis and basic machine learning models
- Public data: City of Chicago datasets and census estimates

## Early Insights

- There is no clear correlation between income and distance to the nearest hospital or clinic.
- Some low-income areas are well-served by primary care providers.
- Only a small number of communities are far from healthcare facilities, and even fewer are both low-income and underserved.
- Some outliers, like New City, may warrant further investigation due to multiple barriers.
